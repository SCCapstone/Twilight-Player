<h1>What features does the app offer?</h1>

Users have access to personally made playlists for files they have downloaded or they can also create their own personal playlists in case they only want specific audio files in one place. All you have to do is press the "Add" button and it will prompt you to give the playlist a name and after the playlist is created, you can add any files you would like.
